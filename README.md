## Day 1 Reflections

I learned about the different ways one can create arrays in Python as I haven't used Python too much in complex problems due to my school not having class on Python. It was also good to refresh on the basics of Python as I've always ended up having to force myself to use the benefits that Python give in the ease and cleanliness that Python codes provide as I'm used to coding in more explicit languages.

## Day 2 Reflections

Today, I learned about the different types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. In particular, learning about semi-supervised was easy for me because an example of computer vision's object identification came into my head; if a computer was trying to sort pictures of cats and dogs, you might label some pictures as dogs and some as cats to give a baseline for the computer, then let the algorithm look at a bunch of unlabeled pictures to create a model.
